# 3.3

<br>

## Hack 1

<br>

### Python

<br>


```python
# Assigning an integer variable with a value of 19
first = 19

# Assigning an integer variable with a value of 21
second = 21

# Assigning an integer variable with a value of the sum of the first two
third = first + second

# Assigning an integer variable with a value of the quotient of the third and 4
fourth = third / 4

# Output the fourth value (10.0)
print(fourth)
```

    Go play outside!


<br>

### JavaScript

<br>


```javascript
%%javascript

// Assigning an integer variable with a value of 19
let first = 19;

// Assigning an integer variable with a value of 21
let second = 21;

// Assigning an integer variable with a value of the sum of the first two
let third = first + second;

// Assigning an integer variable with a value of the quotient of the third and 4
let fourth = third / 4;

// Output the fourth value (10.0)
console.log(fourth);
```

<br>

## Hack 2

<br>

### Python

<br>


```python
# Assigning an integer variable with a value of 19
first = 19

# Assigning an integer variable with a value of 21
second = 21

# Assigning an integer variable with a value of the product of the first two
third = first * second

# Output the third value (399)
print(third)

# Assigning an integer variable with a value of the remainder of the third divided by the second
fourth = third % second

# Output the fourth value (0)
print(fourth)
```

    Wow the friends' names have the same amount of letters!


<br>

### JavaScript

<br>


```javascript
%%javascript

// Assigning an integer variable with a value of 19
let first = 19;

// Assigning an integer variable with a value of 21
let second = 21;

// Assigning an integer variable with a value of the product of the first two
let third = first * second;

// Output the third value (399)
console.log(third);

// Assigning an integer variable with a value of the remainder of the third divided by the second
let fourth = third % second;

// Output the fourth value (0)
console.log(fourth);
```

<br>

## Hack 3

<br>

### Python

<br>


```python
# Assigning an integer variable with a value of 19
first = 19

# Assigning an integer variable with a value of 21
second = 21

# Assigning an integer variable with a value of the difference of the first two
third = second - first

# Output the third value (2)
print(third)
```

    You are a teenager


<br>

### JavaScript

<br>


```javascript
%%javascript

// Assigning an integer variable with a value of 19
let first = 19;

// Assigning an integer variable with a value of 21
let second = 21;

// Assigning an integer variable with a value of the difference of the first two
let third = second - first;

// Output the third value (2)
console.log(third);
```

<br>

## Homework

<br>

### Python

<br>


```python
# Assigning an integer variable with a value of 19
first = 19

# Assigning an integer variable with a value of 21
second = 21

# Output the sum of the values (40)
print(first + second)

# Output the difference of the values (-2)
print(first - second)

# Output the quotient of the values (0.905...)
print(first / second)

# Output the product of the values (399)
print(first * second)

# Output the first to the power of the second value (huge number)
print(first ** second)
```

### JavaScript

<br>


```javascript
%%javascript

// Assigning an integer variable with a value of 19
let first = 19;

// Assigning an integer variable with a value of 21
let second = 21;

// Output the sum of the values (40)
console.log(first + second);

// Output the difference of the values (-2)
console.log(first - second);

// Output the quotient of the values (0.905...)
