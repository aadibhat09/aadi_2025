# 3.6

<br>

## Hack 1

<br>

Create a simple conditional statement.

<br>


```python
# Declaring two boolean values
is_raining = False
is_bored = True

# Compares one value to the opposite of the other value
if is_bored and not is_raining:
    print("Go play outside!")
else:
    print("idk what to tell you man")
```

    Go play outside!


<br>

## Hack 2

<br>

Create a piece of code that compares two statements and checks if they are equal to each other.

<br>


```python
# Declaring two string values
friend_one = "Billy"
friend_two = "Bobby"

# Declaring two integer values
friend_one_length = len(friend_one)
friend_two_length = len(friend_two)

# Compares the values with each other
if friend_one == friend_two:
    print("Wow the friends have the same name!")
elif friend_one_length == friend_two_length:
    print("Wow the friends' names have the same amount of letters!")
else:
    print("The friends have completely different names.")
```

    Wow the friends' names have the same amount of letters!


<br>

## Hack 3

<br>

Create a simple program that classifies an individual as a “Child,” “Teenager,” or “Adult” based on their age input.

<br>


```python
age = int(input())

if age < 13:
    print("You are a child")
elif age < 18:
    print("You are a teenager")
else:
    print("You are an adult")
```

    You are a teenager


<br>

## Hack 4

<br>

Create a counter function that takes input.

<br>


```python
# Defining a function that takes an integer parameter, `n`
def counter(n):

    # Loop `n` times
    for i in range(n):

        # Take input
        inp = input("Type the number " + str(i))

        # Continue if the number is correct, break if it isn't
        if int(inp) == i:
            continue
        else:
            print("Come on man...")
            break

# Call the function with value of user's input
counter(int(input("Enter any number! ")))
```
