## OpenStreetMap Hotel Finder Feature

Strengths:
- API fetch works with user input
- Hotels are displayed in cards and are organized
- Easy for user to add a review

Weaknesses:
- Pressing "Go" again does not refresh the page and you have to scroll down to see new hotels
- Card only shows information about hotel name, city name, and country name

Next Steps:
- Pressing "Go" should refresh the page before loading hotels
- Collect address, etc. from OpenStreetMap API and display on card

<br>

## Hotel Review Feature

Strengths:
- User can see all reviews that were added
- Cards show who added the review and their note
- Admins can manage all reviews

Weaknesses:
- Admins are able to change the rating of any review which does not make sense
- No particular order for hotel cards

Next Steps:
- Only allow admins to delete posts, not update them
- Sort cards by their hotel or city

<br>

## Backend Admin Dashboard

Strengths:
- Admins can log in and access user database
- Jinja is styled to follow InterTravel Theme
- Buttons link to proper InterTravel pages

Weaknesses:
- Cannot view other tables, only users
- Still some items left from original Flask backend

Next Steps:
- Add all tables from features to the Jinja so that admins can manage everything easily
- Make entire page relate to InterTravle theme
