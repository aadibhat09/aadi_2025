## Blog

<br>

The key concepts in this unit have been helping me prepare for challenge-based and project-based learning that CollegeBoard will challenge me with. These lessons have given me a deeper understanding of data types, variables, conditionals, and operators. Our group collaborated well to create our content and our class communicated well to get things done efficiently. I also implemented several unique aspects to our lesson, including interactive quizzes on each page. This shows that I am ready for challenge-based and project-based learning.

<br>

## Memory

<br>

Our group went over lessons 3.1 and 3.4. Apart from covering data types, naming conventions, strings and functions in both Python and Javascript, we also added unique aspects such as the interactive quiz. This made our lessons much more engaging and memorable to the class.

<br>

## Relevancy

<br>

I learned data abstraction and usage of JSON files in lesson 3.2. This lesson was great because it taught us how to create our own JSON files and edit and parse data. I learned how to do this in both Python and JavaScript.

<br>

## Beyond Perfunctory

<br>

As stated before, I made our lesson unique by adding quizzes and themes. I also worked very hard on my classmates' homework assignments, such as this [extra](units/3/7) assignment that I made for lesson 3.7. I grew throughout this unit as my understanding of coding in JS increased. I learned how to use JSON files, booleans and rational operators, if statements, and many more throughout this unit.

<br>
These are the homework files that I have submitted for the other table groups in my class.

Our table covered 3.1 and 3.4, so the links lead to our website.
