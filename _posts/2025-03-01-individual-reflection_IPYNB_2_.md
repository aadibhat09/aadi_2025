## Strengths

This trimester has helped me use my skills in CSP to create a wonderful project. Some of the skills that I have honed include:
- Collaborating with my team members and making sure that everyone understands their feature and roe
- Coming up with fun ideas to implement onto our features
- Fixing problems with our code quickly through debugging
- Helping out with other people in CSP

## Weaknesses

I also have a few things I need to work on, such as:
- Time management; I need to make sure that our team has finished their features well before the day of live reviews so we don't end up panicking at the last minute.
- Listening to team members; Sometimes it is hard for me to incorporate my team feedback so I need to make sure that I listen and understand their feedback and incorporate it.

## Future Goals

Next in computer science, I hope to participate in hackathons with my friends and create projects that use AI to make a difference. This is what I am interested in and I have made a few projects related to this already.

I have also signed up for many computer science Summer programs and internships that I hope to attend, such as COSMOS at UCSC, SIP at UCSC, RMP at UCSB, and SRA at UCSB.

I will also work towards updating my own portfolio website, which you can find [here](https://aadibh.at).

Next year, I plan on taking the AP CSA exam. I enjoyed being able to get creative in CSP and I hope to apply similar skills in the next level of AP programming. I have experience in Java and OOP and I will be able to apply this as well.
