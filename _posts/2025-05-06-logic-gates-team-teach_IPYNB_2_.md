### Real-World Applications of Logic Gates

Logic gates are essential components of modern digital systems. Below are some deeper insights into real-world applications using the listed impacts:

1. **Authorization Process (AND Gate)**  
   An access system might require both a **keycard AND a PIN** to grant entry. This ensures **multi-factor authentication**â€”increasing security by requiring two independent credentials. If either the keycard or the PIN is missing, access is denied, reducing the risk of unauthorized entry.

2. **Automatic Door Activation (OR Gate)**  
   A door could open when **either a motion sensor OR a button** is triggered. This increases accessibility and convenience. For example, people carrying items or using wheelchairs may prefer motion activation, while others might prefer using a manual button.

3. **Thermostat System (NOT Gate)**  
   In temperature control, a **NOT gate** can invert a condition. When the desired temperature is reached, the NOT gate flips the signal to turn **off** the heating/cooling system, helping with energy efficiency.

4. **Self-Driving Cars (NAND & NOR Gates)**  
   Cars use logic gates to make safety decisions. For example, based on multiple inputs (like proximity sensors), a **NAND gate** could determine when **not** to apply brakes unless all safety conditions are met. These gates help evaluate complex rules quickly, ensuring **real-time decisions**.

5. **Computer Memory Check (XOR Gate)**  
   In memory storage, an **XOR gate** checks if two pieces of data are **different**, which is useful in error detection algorithms like **parity checking**. This ensures data integrity during transmission or storage.

6. **Pattern Recognition (XNOR Gate)**  
   An **XNOR gate** checks if two patterns are **the same**. This is valuable in **image and voice recognition systems** where a stored input must match the real-time input for access or validation.

**Question:**  
A digital circuit receives three binary inputs: X, Y, and Z. The circuit outputs 1 if and only if **X AND Y are both 1, OR Z is 1**.

**Correct Answer:**  
**A. (X AND Y) OR Z**

**Explanation:**  
- The condition describes two cases that result in output 1:
  - If both X and Y are 1 (i.e., `X AND Y`)
  - Or if Z is 1, regardless of the other inputs  
- So the correct logic is `(X AND Y) OR Z`.

## Homework Hack: Authorization System

Below is the completed Python function that simulates a secure entry system using an AND gate with **three** required inputs: keycard, pin, and voice authorization.


```python
def secure_entry_system(keycard, pin, voice_auth):
    def AND(a, b):
        return a & b

    return AND(AND(keycard, pin), voice_auth)

print(secure_entry_system(1, 1, 1))  # (Access Granted)
print(secure_entry_system(1, 1, 0))  # (Access Denied)
print(secure_entry_system(0, 1, 1))  # (Access Denied)
print(secure_entry_system(1, 0, 1))  # (Access Denied)
```
