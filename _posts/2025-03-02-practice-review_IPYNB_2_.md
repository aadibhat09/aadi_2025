I reviewed my final project with both Ms. Pataki and Mihir Bapat, a student in another CSP period. These reviews were helpful in giving feedback, especially when the person has not seen our project before.

After these reviews, I refined my feature and my presentation before N@TM to be more engaging. For example, I was told to go more in depth about the backend and how requests are sent, so I incorporated this into my final N@TM presentation.

Mihir advised me to be more clear when presenting my 5 big things so that someone who has never seen my project before will understand my contributions. I incorporated this into my N@TM presentation to be more engaging.
