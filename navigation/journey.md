So far in my journey in AP Computer Science Principles, I:
- Installed WSL through PowerShell
- Made a `nighthawk` folder in my home directory
- Cloned the portfolio repository in my `nighthawk` folder
- Ran the `activate_ubuntu.sh` script in the repository to install all necessary packages
- Made my own repository and cloned it into my `nighthawk` folder
- Changed the `index.md` markdown file and made my first commit

So far in my journey in AP CSP, I did the following:

1. Install WSL through PowerShell

    - `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04`

2. Open Ubuntu

3. Make a `nighthawk` folder in your `~/` directory and change your directory to it

    - `mkdir nighthawk`
    - `cd nighthawk`

4. Clone the portfolio repository

    - `git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/portfolio_2025.git`

5. Change your directory to the `scripts` folder in the portfolio directory, and run the `activate_ubuntu.sh` script

    - `cd portfolio_2025/scripts`
    - `./activate_ubuntu.sh`
    - This will install all the necessary packages, such as Python, Jupyter, Ruby, and Bundle.
