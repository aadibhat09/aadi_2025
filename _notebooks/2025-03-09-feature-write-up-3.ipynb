    "My feature for this project is Lodging Listings. It allows users to enter the name of a hotel and a city and find a list of all hotels available in that city with the name. The user can add a rating out of 5 stars and a note to the hotel. On another page, users are able to see all reviews of hotels and the name of the user that added the review. Users can edit their own posts, and admins have the permission to delete any post.\n",

    "This function takes in four parameters from the DOM. A fifth argument is inputted by the user once the function is called, and these five arguments are sent to the backend to store in a database.\n",

    "This meets the CPT requirement of **user input handling** because the `rating` and `note` parameters are inputted by the user through a text field. This also meets the requirement of **list usage** by collecting the hotel information from the DOM. Furthermore, this utilizes **algorithm implementation** by first **sequencing** (posts a hotel from user input and update UI to say \"rating added\"), **selecting** (makes sure that all parameters, including the `note`, are available), **iteration** (using a loop to iterate through all hotel cards and add them to the DOM), and **program output** (by updating the button from saying \"add rating\" to \"rated\").\n",
