    "I was the assistant scrum master of a seven-person group developing a website to make travelling easier. As a group, we all developed features to assist with a user who plans on travelling to another city. The user would be able to search for hotels, restaurants, activities, provide and look for reviews, create a packing checklist, and many more. Individually, I was in charge of creating Lodging Listings, a feature that allowed the user to search for a hotel given a city and hotel name and look at reviews from other users. I used a hotel API to search for hotels and interact with the user.\n",

    "I was the assistant scrum master of a six-person group developing a website to ease building and street repairs in San Diego. We worked on a model that uses preactive fixing instead of reactive fixing in order to fix building and street problems before they become too severe. Individually, I worked on a CSV data uploader to allow workers to add their own data and visualize it. I also worked on a Maintenance Map to allow workers to easily visualize which buildings need repairs and how severe the repairs are.\n",

    "I was the scrum master of a three-person group adding on to the Open Coding Society pages to develop a more sophisticated and accurate GitHub analytics page. We all worked together to create a page that shows the user the amount of commits, line changes, issues, pull requests, etc. they have in the past trimester. There is also a grid of cards linking back to each of the user's commits for organization. Based on their contributions, the user is able to calculate their grade with a model. Additionally, an administrator such as a teacher account would be able to search for any of their students to see their contributions.\n",
