    "### Group's purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "\"To make a budget-friendly travel planner that will allow users to find activities, hotels, restaurants, and much more.\"\n",
    "- Activity Planner: users can search for activities in the city they are visiting and ask questions to a chatbot for help.\n",
    "- Lodging Listings: users can search for hotels in their city and give them a star rating.\n",
    "- Packing Portal: users can select which items to carry with them while travelling.\n",
    "- Cuisine Chronicles: users can view the menu of restaurants and give reviews.\n",
    "- Fair Fares: users can search for flights to and from their destination and compare prices.\n",
    "- Budget Brilliance: users can set their budget for the trip and see suggestions.\n",
    "- Wellness waypoints: users can search for hospitals in their area in the case of an emergency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "My feature is Lodging Listings. This feature allows users to enter the name of a hotel and a city, and uses an online API to collect information on these hotels. The user can then give hotels a rating out of 5 stars and save them for later. If the user is no longer interested in the hotel or has a different opinion, they can unsave the hotel or change its rating.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `const data = await response.json();`\n",
    "    - Parse the JSON response from the API into a JavaScript object.\n",
    "2. `data.forEach((index) => {`\n",
    "    - Iterate through each item in the data.\n",
    "3. `const card = document.createElement(\"div\");`\n",
    "    - Create a new div which will contain information from the data.\n",
    "4. `const hotelTitle = index['display_name'].split(', ')[0];`\n",
    "    - Get individual info from the data.\n",
    "    - Repeat for city and country.\n",
    "5. `const hotelElement = document.createElement(\"h2\");`\n",
    "    - Create a new header which will contain information from the hotel name.\n",
    "    - Repeat for city and country.\n",
    "6. `card.appendChild(hotelElement);`\n",
    "    - Add the hotel element to the card div.\n",
    "    - Repeat for city and country.\n",
    "7. `body.appendChild(card);`\n",
    "    - Add the card div to the body so that it shows in the frontend.\n",
