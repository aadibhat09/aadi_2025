    "# Comparison to the Beginning of the Year\n",
    "\n",
    "Going into CSA as a junior, I had some prior experience in Java. I completed AP CSP last year, so I had knowledge about working using AGILE methodology and full-stack development. I also programmed in Java in robotics (FRC), so I had prior knowledge in Java programming\n",
    "\n",
    "That doesn't mean I didn't develop new skills this trimester. Over the past few months...\n",
    "- I’ve gained a better understanding of how object-oriented programming connects to real-world problem-solving.\n",
    "- I’ve improved at writing modular code, organizing projects into classes and methods that make programs easier to maintain.\n",
    "- I’ve also gained experience working with backend development using Spring Boot, learning how to structure controllers, services, and repositories.\n",
    "- I've increased my proficiency in using LLM APIs, such as Gemini.\n",
    "- I’ve become more comfortable working with JSON, API endpoints, and managing backend-to-frontend communication.\n",
    "- I've learned how to store data in the SQLite databse in the Spring backend.\n",
    "- I’ve improved my communication in group work by discussing ideas clearly, dividing tasks effectively, and helping teammates troubleshoot.\n",
    "- I’ve also started to think more critically about design and efficiency, rather than just getting code to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this trimester, I've grown in many ways, both technical and nontechnical. I've improved my proficiency in coding in Java, especially in a full-stack environment. I've also worked on my communication and teamwork skills with both my group of 6 and the entire class, as our entire class all collaborated on the same project. This trimester was a great experience for me and I look forward to the next trimester!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Things Across the Trimester\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important things across this trimester that I contributed were...\n",
    "- Spring boot API: I created an API in the Spring backend with an endpoint that could be accessed by the frontend.\n",
    "- Database storing: I stored data submitted by the user in a database to be able to log data.\n",
    "- Gemini API: I used the Gemini API and engineered a prompt to grade students' answers to FRQs.\n",
    "- Quest: I was a part of the \"user\" team for the Quest of Code, and I helped oversee the organization and development of our modules.\n",
    "- Collegeboard Topics: My team and I researched a topic on Collegeboard for the AP CSA exam and presented a lesson on it to the rest of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Future Project\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the future, I hope to polish our current modules by improving styling and integrating more interactive tools.\n",
    "- Each team had great ideas and contributed strong work toward our quest.\n",
    "- However, some styling and CSS design choices were inconsistent across modules.\n",
    "- Each module also included different features — for example, one team built a drag-and-drop quiz while another created an FRQ grader.\n",
    "- While these unique features are valuable, I believe all modules should share some common tools and styling for a more unified user experience.\n",
    "- This would help merge our class’s creativity and ideas into one cohesive final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Next Steps in CompSci\n",
    "\n",
    "This project showed me how much I enjoy building systems that connect software, users, and data. I want to expand my knowledge in areas such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cloud infrastructure – learning how to deploy and scale applications using services like AWS, GCP, or Azure.\n",
    "- API architecture – designing clean, versioned, and well-documented APIs that support multiple clients.\n",
    "- Database optimization – improving query performance, learning about indexing, and exploring NoSQL structures.\n",
    "- Automation and testing – implementing unit tests, integration tests, and automated build pipelines.\n",
    "- UI/UX engineering – creating smoother interactions between frontend tools and backend logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, I want to focus on how different layers of software work together efficiently, building systems that are reliable, maintainable, and user-centered.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "I contributed heavily to our class's codebase, both frontend and backend. My strong work in computer science can be shown through these analytics.\n",
