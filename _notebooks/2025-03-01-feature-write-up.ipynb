    "\n",
    "My feature for this project is Lodging Listings. It allows users to enter the name of a hotel and a city and find a list of all hotels available in that city with the name. The user can add a rating out of 5 stars and a note to the hotel. On another page, users are able to see all reviews of hotels and the name of the user that added the review. Users can edit their own posts, and admins have the permission to delete any post.\n",

    "## Big Idea 1.4\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Idea 1.4 is about debugging code and fixing errors. This was a big part of my journey while developing my feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backend Debugging**: Before I tested my API on my frontend, I used Postman to ensure that I was able to submit requests to the backend and receive a response. Here, I use a GET request to my hotel API in the backend to receive information about the hotels that I have stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/writeup/postman-get.png\" width=\"1000px\" height=\"auto\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Frontend Debugging**: After I receieved a successful response through Postman, I attempted to repeat these requests through my frontend and viewing the console output to analyze errors. Here, I received an error because I am not logged in and I am not able to access my hotel API.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/writeup/frontend-errors.png\" width=\"500px\" height=\"auto\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **End-to-End Tracing**: Now, I had to ensure that the data flow between the frontend and backend was seamless. I would attempt a GET request on the frontend to see if I could fetch data from the backend, or a POST request on the frontend to see if I could add data to the backend. Here, I am posting information about a hotel from the frontend to the backend, and the data shows in the backend table.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/writeup/post-hotel.gif\" width=\"1000px\" height=\"auto\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing**: I added some test data to my backend to validate the functionality and performance of my API. This test data includes random hotels and ratings and it shows in my frontend as well. This tester data is initialized through my initHotel() method and will be added to the database whenever I initialize the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def initHotel():\n",
    "\n",
    "    with app.app_context():\n",
    "\n",
    "        db.create_all()\n",

    "        test_data = [\n",

    "## Big Idea 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Idea 2 is about managing and storing data in a database. This is how I incorporated this idea into my feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database Management with SQLite**: My hotel data is stored in a table in the user_management database, and I can view and edit the data through SQLite. Whenever I submit a POST, PUT, or DELETE request, the data in the table will be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/writeup/hotel-data.png\" width=\"1000px\" height=\"auto\">\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src=\"../../images/writeup/pfp.png\" width=\"500px\" height=\"auto\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Security and Privacy**: Normal users are only able to delete and update their own posts. However, to keep the website safe, admins are able to delete any post that they deem unsafe. I incorporated this through a conditional in my DELETE method in my hotel API.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def delete(self):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    current_user = g.current_user\n",

    "        return {'message': 'ID is required for deleting a hotel'}, 400\n",
    "\n",
    "    if current_user.role == 'Admin':\n",
    "        hotel = Hotel.query.get(data['id'])\n",
    "        if not hotel:\n",
    "            return {'message': 'Hotel not found'}, 404\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            hotel.delete()\n",
    "            return {'message': 'Hotel deleted successfully'}, 200\n",
    "        except Exception as e:\n",
    "            return {'message': f'Error deleting hotel: {e}'}, 500\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Backup and Recovery**: To ensure that there is minimal accidental data loss, I implemented a script that will back up the database to a separate database. Through Cockpit, I have added a crontab that runs this script periodically so that we will always have a copy of the database if needed.\n",
    "\n",

    "Big Idea 4 is about deploying the Flask project onto the internet so that it is available for anyone to use. This is how I, as the group's deployment admin, accomplished this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deployment Strategies**: Our teacher set up an AWS server for all groups to deploy their projects onto. I added a record for `intertravel.stu.nighthawkcodingsociety.com` to deploy the Flask backend. I also added our repository to the Cockpit to be able to update it when needed.\n",
