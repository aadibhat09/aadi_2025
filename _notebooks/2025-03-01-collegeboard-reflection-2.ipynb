    "\n",
    "### A student wrote the following program to remove all occurrences of the strings `\"the\"` and `\"a\"` from the list `wordList`. While debugging the program, the student realizes that the loop never terminates. Which of the following changes can be made so that the program works as intended?\n",

    "\n",
    "I chose answer B, which is `Inserting index ← index + 1 between lines 7 and 8`. However, this is incorrect because the index starts at the end of the wordlist, not the start, so it must decrease in value after each iteration to go down the wordlist.\n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "### The procedure `BinarySearch (numList, target)` correctly implements a binary search algorithm on the list of numbers `numList`. The procedure returns an index where `target` occurs in `numList`, or `-1` if `target` does not occur in `numList`.

    "I chose answer B, which is `The list numList must not contain any duplicate values`. However, this is incorrect because a binary search does not depend on whether the list contains duplicate values, but the list must be sorted for `target` to be able to be located in `numList`.\n",

This still returns the intended value because `\"spruce\"` does not appear in `treeList` at all, thus `count` will never change and will be displayed at `0`.\n",

    "## Wrapping up\n",
    "\n",
    "I need to familiarize myself with topics such as time complexity, like in question 50, and certificate authority, like in question 40. I also missed a few questions because I did not spend enough time thouroughly reading each answer choice, which is why I missed 16, as I had thought that the index value was increasing and not decreasing. Overall, this MCQ shows that I should slow down on each question and familiarize myself with non-programming topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the last practice test I took, I did much better and improved on topics such as citizen science and encryption which I had trouble on last trimester.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I improved on:\n",
    "- Data Compression (67% to 100%)\n",
    "- Variables and Assignments (67% to 100%), Iteration (50% to 100%)\n",
    "- Digital Divide (0% to 100%)\n",
    "- Safe Computing (33% to 67%).\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, I still have not encountered these, but I can practice with other MCQs to understand these topics:\n",
    "- Skill 4.A: Explain how a code segment or program functions\n",
    "- Skill 6.A: Collaborate in the development of solutions\n",
    "- Skill 6.B: Use safe and secure methods when using computing devices\n",
