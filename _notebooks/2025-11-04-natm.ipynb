    "## What We Showcased\n",
    "\n",
    "At N@tM, our team presented the **Computer Science Portfolio project** we've been developing throughout the trimester. The core idea behind our work is to help students build structured modules that showcase their learning, demonstrate technical proficiency, and include meaningful reflections on their growth in computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "The portfolio format transforms typical coding assignments into organized evidence of learning—each module highlights specific learning objectives, includes project artifacts, and contains reflections that connect technical work to deeper understanding. This approach makes computer science learning visible and communicable, not just to teachers but to anyone interested in understanding what we're actually learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Parents' Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Parents who stopped by our display were genuinely curious about how the portfolio system works. They asked questions about the module design process and how students organize their work to demonstrate mastery. Several mentioned they could see this approach being useful in other classes beyond computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "What stood out most was their interest in how we explained both the technical and reflective components of our work. They seemed impressed that we could clearly articulate not just *what* we built, but *why* it matters and *how* it demonstrates learning. One parent specifically commented on how this kind of structured presentation develops communication skills that go beyond coding.\n",

    "## Observing Other Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "Walking around the event, I made it a point to visit other displays and provide feedback on their projects. This was one of the more valuable parts of the night—seeing how different teams approached creativity, data visualization, and problem-solving gave me new perspectives on what makes a project effective and engaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving feedback also made me think more critically about how we present our own work. When I asked other teams questions or suggested improvements, it helped me understand what elements make a project clear and compelling to an outside audience. You learn a lot about your own work when you evaluate others'.\n",

    "## What I Took Away\n",
    "\n",
    "N@tM gave me a chance to see our work through fresh eyes—specifically through the perspectives of parents and teachers who aren't in our class every day. Their reactions and questions made it clear that **communication matters just as much as the code itself**. Being able to explain your technical work in accessible terms is a skill that extends far beyond the classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was also rewarding to see genuine interest from visitors. When people engaged with what we built and asked thoughtful questions, it validated that the work we've been doing all trimester has real value and impact beyond just completing assignments for a grade.\n",
