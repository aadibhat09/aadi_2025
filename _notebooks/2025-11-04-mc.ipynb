    "### **Q15 – String Substring Traversal**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** String methods and loop execution  \n",
    "**Code:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String str = \"lookout\";\n",
    "String target = \"o\";\n",
    "int j = str.indexOf(target);\n",
    "while (j >= 0) { \n",
    "   str = str.substring(j);\n",
    "   System.out.print(str + \" \");\n",
    "   str = str.substring(1);\n",
    "   j = str.indexOf(target);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Approach:**  \n",
    "I assumed the loop would only find the first occurrence of \"o\" and then exit, thinking `substring(1)` would skip past all \"o\" characters. I selected **\"ookout out\"**, missing the second \"o\" in the original string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Approach:**  \n",
    "The loop finds **every** occurrence of \"o\" by continuously shortening `str`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `j = 1` → `str = \"ookout\"` → prints `\"ookout \"`\n",
    "2. `str = \"okout\"` (after `substring(1)`)\n",
    "3. `j = 0` → `str = \"okout\"` → prints `\"okout \"`\n",
    "4. `str = \"kout\"` (after `substring(1)`)\n",
    "5. `j = 1` → `str = \"out\"` → prints `\"out \"`\n",
    "6. `str = \"ut\"` (after `substring(1)`)\n",
    "7. `j = -1` → loop terminates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Output:** `\"ookout okout out\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correction:**  \n",
    "When a loop modifies the string it's searching, trace **every iteration** explicitly. Each `substring(1)` call advances by exactly one character, allowing the loop to find subsequent matches.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Topic:** Software development principles  \n",
    "**Question:** Which action maximizes system reliability?\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Approach:**  \n",
    "I selected **\"Using public visibility for behaviors\"** because I thought making methods accessible would allow better integration testing. I confused accessibility with reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Approach:**  \n",
    "**Testing under a wide variety of conditions** is the primary method to ensure system reliability. This includes:\n",
    "- Edge cases (empty inputs, maximum values)\n",
    "- Different device types and operating systems\n",
    "- Various network conditions\n",
    "- International locales and time zones\n",
    "\n",
    "Making behaviors `public` affects **encapsulation** and **API design**, not reliability. In fact, unnecessary public access can *reduce* reliability by exposing internal implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correction:**  \n",

    "**Code:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Shoe {\n",
    "   private static int count = 0;\n",
    "   \n",
    "   public Shoe() {\n",
    "      size = 7.0;\n",
    "      style = \"boot\";\n",
    "   }\n",
    "  \n",
    "   public Shoe(double mySize, String myStyle) {\n",
    "      size = mySize;\n",
    "      style = myStyle;\n",
    "      count++;\n",

    "Shoe s2 = new Shoe();\n",
    "Shoe s3 = new Shoe(7.0, \"sandal\");\n",
    "System.out.println(Shoe.getCount());\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Approach:**  \n",
    "I assumed both constructors would increment `count`, expecting the output to be **3**. I thought the default constructor would automatically call the increment logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Approach:**  \n",
    "Only the **two-parameter constructor** increments `count`. The no-parameter constructor has no `count++` statement:\n",
    "- `s1` → `count = 1` (two-parameter constructor)\n",
    "- `s2` → `count = 1` (no-parameter constructor, no increment)\n",
    "- `s3` → `count = 2` (two-parameter constructor)\n",

    "   j++;\n",
    "}\n",
    "System.out.println(count);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Approach:**  \n",
    "I selected **2**, counting only the obvious pairs \"bb\" and \"ff\". I overlooked that \"ddd\" contains **two** adjacent equal pairs, not one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Approach:**  \n",
    "The code checks **each adjacent pair** in the string:\n",
    "- Position 1-2: `\"b\" == \"b\"` → count = 1\n",
    "- Position 4-5: `\"d\" == \"d\"` → count = 2\n",

    "   j++;\n",
    "   sum += j;\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Approach:**  \n",
    "I selected **`for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++)`**, thinking the loop added numbers 1 through 5. I didn't account for the fact that `j` increments **before** being added to sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Approach:**  \n",
    "The while loop adds **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6** to sum:\n",
    "- Iteration 1: j=0 → j becomes 1 → sum += 1\n",

    "- ...\n",
    "- Iteration 6: j=5 → j becomes 6 → sum += 6\n",

    "**Key Observation:**  \n",
    "Four of six errors involve **execution tracing** (questions 1, 4, 5, 6). This indicates that mental simulation of code execution is the primary weakness, not conceptual understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## V. Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths\n",
    "- Understanding of OOP principles (constructors, static variables)\n",
    "- Recognition of software engineering best practices\n",
    "- Familiarity with standard algorithms (insertion sort structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses\n",
    "- **Incomplete mental traces** of iterative processes\n",
    "- Tendency to stop tracing too early (off-by-one errors)\n",
    "- Difficulty tracking state changes across multiple loop iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root Cause\n",
    "The common thread is **execution tracking discipline**—moving too quickly through iterations without explicitly writing intermediate states.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## VI. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam revealed a **procedural discipline gap** rather than a conceptual understanding gap. I understand the mechanics of loops, strings, and OOP, but I rush through execution traces, leading to preventable errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, I will adopt a **structured tracing methodology** for all iteration and string manipulation problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a trace table** with columns for loop variable, condition status, and any modified data structures\n",
    "2. **Write out the first 3 iterations explicitly** before attempting to identify patterns\n",
    "3. **Mark the exact line where changes occur** (especially for pre vs. post-increment scenarios)\n",
    "4. **Double-check edge cases** such as the final iteration and adjacent comparison boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, on Q28 (adjacent character comparison), a simple trace table would have immediately revealed:\n",
    "```\n",
    "j | char at j | char at j+1 | match?\n",
    "0 | 'l'      | 'o'        | no\n",
    "1 | 'o'      | 'o'        | YES (count=1)\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This systematic approach transforms tracing from a mental exercise into a verifiable process, eliminating the rushed assumptions that caused 67% of my errors. Rather than relying on intuition, I will build evidence-based confidence through explicit documentation of program state."
