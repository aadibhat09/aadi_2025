    "### Real-World Applications of Logic Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic gates are essential components of modern digital systems. Below are some deeper insights into real-world applications using the listed impacts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Authorization Process (AND Gate)**  \n",
    "   An access system might require both a **keycard AND a PIN** to grant entry. This ensures **multi-factor authentication**â€”increasing security by requiring two independent credentials. If either the keycard or the PIN is missing, access is denied, reducing the risk of unauthorized entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Automatic Door Activation (OR Gate)**  \n",
    "   A door could open when **either a motion sensor OR a button** is triggered. This increases accessibility and convenience. For example, people carrying items or using wheelchairs may prefer motion activation, while others might prefer using a manual button.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Thermostat System (NOT Gate)**  \n",
    "   In temperature control, a **NOT gate** can invert a condition. When the desired temperature is reached, the NOT gate flips the signal to turn **off** the heating/cooling system, helping with energy efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Self-Driving Cars (NAND & NOR Gates)**  \n",
    "   Cars use logic gates to make safety decisions. For example, based on multiple inputs (like proximity sensors), a **NAND gate** could determine when **not** to apply brakes unless all safety conditions are met. These gates help evaluate complex rules quickly, ensuring **real-time decisions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Computer Memory Check (XOR Gate)**  \n",
    "   In memory storage, an **XOR gate** checks if two pieces of data are **different**, which is useful in error detection algorithms like **parity checking**. This ensures data integrity during transmission or storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Pattern Recognition (XNOR Gate)**  \n",
    "   An **XNOR gate** checks if two patterns are **the same**. This is valuable in **image and voice recognition systems** where a stored input must match the real-time input for access or validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Popcorn Hack 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**  \n",
    "A digital circuit receives three binary inputs: X, Y, and Z. The circuit outputs 1 if and only if **X AND Y are both 1, OR Z is 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:**  \n",
    "**A. (X AND Y) OR Z**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "- The condition describes two cases that result in output 1:\n",
    "  - If both X and Y are 1 (i.e., `X AND Y`)\n",
    "  - Or if Z is 1, regardless of the other inputs  \n",
    "- So the correct logic is `(X AND Y) OR Z`.\n",
