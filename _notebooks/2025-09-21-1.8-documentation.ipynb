    "1. Why is documentation more important in team projects than solo projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation is more important in team proejcts than in solo projects, because in team projects it is important that other people understand what your code does and that you understand what other people's code does. Documentation helps to convey what your code does among other information. In solo projects, you would likely have a good idea of all aspects of the code you created, so there is not much reason to be documenting it unless you plan on sharing it with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Give an example of when a method SHOULD be documented and when it SHOULD NOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex methods that have multiple checks or have important side effects should always have detailed documentation. Simple helper methods don't really need documentation, especially if the name of the method describes its purpose well enough.\n",
