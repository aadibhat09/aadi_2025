    "The key concepts in this unit have been helping me prepare for challenge-based and project-based learning. These lessons have given me a deeper understanding of data types, variables, conditionals, and operators. Our group collaborated well to create our content and our class communicated well to get things done efficiently. I also implemented several unique aspects to our lesson, including interactive quizzes on each page. This shows that I am ready for challenge-based and project-based learning.\n",

I also worked very hard on my classmates' homework assignments, such as this [extra](units/3/7) assignment that I made for lesson 3.7. I grew throughout this unit as my understanding of coding in JS increased. I learned how to use JSON files, booleans and rational operators, if statements, and many more throughout this unit.\n",
